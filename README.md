This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# Objective
A simple application demonstrating the use cases of these React hooks

- useState – Manages local state in a functional component.
- useEffect – Runs side effects after render, like data fetching or subscriptions.
- useMemo – Memoizes a computed value to avoid expensive recalculations.
- useCallback – Memoizes a function to prevent unnecessary re-creations on re-render.
- useRef – Keeps a mutable reference that persists across renders without causing re-renders.
- useContext – Accesses values from a React Context without prop drilling.
- Custom hooks – Encapsulate reusable stateful logic across components.
- useReducer – Manages complex state logic with a reducer pattern similar to Redux.
